# Context and Motivation
---

The Murmur Protocol was born from dissatisfaction with the main debate around AI. 
Simply put, and as for any debate nowadays, 2 main frames are observed:

- the "AI evangelists", techno enthusiasts and PR leaning advocate for AI often focusing on productivity even when talking about solution for a more sustainable future. No talk about how to help critical thinking through, for instance speculative fictioning. Just a wet dream of technofix: AI will help us being more productive, and solve humanity more complicate issues (often implying technofixes to climate change as if we had no idea of what to do about it. ) It is just a corporate cult to a Deus ex Machina justifying unhinged corporate greed (Sam Altman complained that limitation to data was a unfair, Trump and Starmer are now suggesting limiting legislation on AI... ). 
  These people seem to have no understanding of society needs (everything seem to be reduced to productivity), no faith in humanity and they sound, to be honest simply bewitched by their own myths.

- the Anti AI, telling tales of AI doom, even when moderate, or simply that AI would take our jobs and we would find ourselves in a situation even worse than we are now. Ecological concerns are also an incentive for limiting AI use, and of course the fact that AI belongs to big tech which could at anytime turn AI to their advantage to spread misinformation (ie the Grok hallucination about White Genocide in South Africa...). 
  I naturally align more with them, minus the Doomism - which I have simply about the main economic system that we have been living since at least the Cold War if not from the start of industrialisation. 
  But, from a media studies point of view, this looks a lot like a kind of hate-bait outrage, and even though their talk of inevitable apocalypse appear dramatic, not many of these "anti-AI" appear to suggest radical systemic changes.

On the margin you can of course find some interesting debate, but you have to dig and mostly look for quite specialised media, which could be fair enough it AI was still in closed research mode, not out in the open for anyone to create  a Ghibli version of them.

What worries me about the state of this debate (apart from its constant noise) is that it may create a self fulfilling prophecy of Doom: Pro AI will AI, while anti AI won't... So in the end AI will be shaped only by the fantasies of the technocratic class who care more about there smart toaster than child labour in a country they can't place on a map.

As it is, orientation of commercial AI tools hold a bias toward speed, clarity, and surface satisfaction. 
Models like ChatGPT are trained to deliver high-confidence answers optimised for engagement this imply dismissing voices that may be controversial or increase the complexity of the answer. 
How could such model fulfil the prophecy made by their crea-curators of "answering the most complicated question of humanity" if they are only considering a flat, smooth version of those problem inside a very determined and closed worldview made to maintain the status quo?


If the incentive of not using AI pushes people who care to not use AI, then only people who don't care, who are aligned with the current general idea of growth, hyper capitalism and even harmful politics - extractive, against trans people right, fearing migrants...- will use it and they will push answers made by so-called "intelligence" to justify their choices. 
This tactics it dangerous as there will be no chances to prove that a differently aligned AI would be beneficial. The resistance will remain a shout in the void, while silicon valley continue to impose its hegemony on institution and government. 

There will be either no incentive for tech company to reevaluate their model to become more challenging and inclusive. No incentive for plurality, only safe consumer pleasing strategy. 

And since AI are close source software we have no possibility to change the core alignment of models. 
Furthermore, AI needs so much resources that only the wealthiest companies can produce new model, companies that by definition, have no interest in challenging the statu quo.
So I started playing, experimenting. 

The Murmur protocol is a result of this experimentations. 
This is nothing really new, some will say that this merely prompt engineering, but I don't believe this has be done this way and for this purpose.

And if it has already been done, good! It means I'm not the only mad person who still believes we can still control the tools that are imposed on us.
